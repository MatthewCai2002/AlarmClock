# My Persistent Alarm Clock Project

## What it does

The app is designed to wake up users by forcing the user to use their brain in an engaging way,
helping them overcome that morning tiredness and desire to stay in bed; making them more active
and productive.
The app acts as a standard alarm clock 
with the ability to set an alarm at any time on a 12 hour that will ring at that set time.
This alarm will exist indefinitely until removed by the user. Furthermore, turning off the alarm
will require a specific action to be done. In the first iteration this action would be a simple 
problem that would have to be correctly answered to turn off the alarm and incorrect attempts will 
not turn off the alarm. In later iterations a timer feature could also be added however,
it will not require a specific action to turn off. Furthermore, an override feature could be added 
so that if a user is unable to correctly answer a problem they can still shut off their alarm after
a set amount of attempts. In addition, a feature that locks your computer when the alarm goes off
could be considered to enforce the alarm. Other features include volume setters, 
more ringtones, and an alarm toggle will be added as well. 

## Who will use it

The intended user base are people who have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and feel
consistently tired after they wake up. By stimulating higher brain function when they wake up it 
forces them to wake up faster to shut off their alarm thereby, helping them wake up faster.

## My interest in creating this app

Previously I used to wake up and get out of bed in the morning at 6:00am consistently every day. However,
over the fall term I have noticed that I have been sleeping later as well as waking up later, and I have
been on my phone for longer periods of time in the morning. So to counteract my habits faltering I
want to create an app that forces me to wake up and get out of bed in the morning to help maintain 
my morning habit.
