# My Persistent Alarm Clock Project

## What it does

The app is designed to wake up users by forcing the user to use their brain in an engaging way,
helping them overcome that morning tiredness and desire to stay in bed; making them more active
and productive. The app acts as a standard alarm clock with the ability to set an alarm at 
any time on a 24 hour clock that will ring at that set time. This alarm will exist 
indefinitely until removed by the user. Furthermore, the alarm can be toggled active or inactive
to prevent the alarm from going off indefinitely without deleting it. 

Turning off the alarm will require a specific action to be done. 
In the first iteration this action would be a simple problem that would have to be 
correctly answered to turn off the alarm and incorrect attempts will not turn off the alarm. 
In later iterations a timer feature could also be added, as well as an override feature
so that if a user is unable to correctly answer a problem they can still shut off their alarm after
a too many attempts. In addition, a feature that locks your computer when the alarm goes off
could be considered to enforce the alarm. Other features include volume setters, 
more ringtones, and an alarm toggle will be added as well. 

## Who will use it

The intended user base are people who have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and feel
consistently tired after they wake up. By stimulating higher brain function when they wake up it 
forces them to wake up faster to shut off their alarm thereby, helping them wake up faster.

## My interest in creating this app

Previously I used to wake up and get out of bed in the morning at 6:00am consistently every day. However,
over the fall term I have noticed that I have been sleeping later as well as waking up later, and I have
been on my phone for longer periods of time in the morning. So to counteract my habits faltering I
want to create an app that forces me to wake up and get out of bed in the morning to help maintain 
my morning habit.
